# Bonus-Calculator
End-of-year bonus calculator created to input technicians' hours and output bonus amounts based on weekly hours and streaks of hours throughout the year.

This real-world project was created for my job. I wanted to find a way to use what I have learned in Python to calculate the end of year bonuses for technicians and dispatchers.
Weekly hours are entered at the end of the year, various counters are incremented based on hours entered, and the payout amounts are updated based on meeting the 33 hour
weekly requirement and the number of weeks in which a technician meets that weekly goal.
